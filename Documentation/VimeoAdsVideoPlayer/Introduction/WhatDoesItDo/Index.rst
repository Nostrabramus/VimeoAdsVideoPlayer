What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Vimeo Ads Video Player* allows you to view one or more Vimeo's videos
in your website inside an iframe simply by entering one or more Vimeo
video ids, with no need of embedded code. It also allows you to
configure directly the width and the height of the video together with
some other useful features such as autoplay, mute, loop and random
start (if you have a list of video).

Thanks to Juerg Langhard, author of the extension grb\_vimeo, that we
have used as a starting point for this extension.
